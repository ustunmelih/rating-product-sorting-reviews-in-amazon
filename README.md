## Business Case

One of the most important problems in e-commerce is accurately calculating post-purchase ratings for products. Solving this issue leads to greater customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, better product visibility for sellers, and a smooth shopping experience for buyers. Another key problem is properly ranking product reviews. Misleading reviews can negatively impact sales, leading to financial loss and loss of customers. By solving these two main problems, e-commerce platforms and sellers can increase their sales, while customers can enjoy a seamless shopping experience.
